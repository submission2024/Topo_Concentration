# Topo-Concentration
This repository is an official PyTorch(Geometric) implementation of the submission of the paper 'A Topological Perspective on Demystifying GNN-Based Link Prediction Performance'.

This repository includes three folder:
- **TC-expr-small**: Link prediction experiment with GCN/SAGE and with our enhanced reweight strategy on Cora/Citeseer/Pubmed/Reptile/Vole.
- **TC-expr-collab**: Link prediction experiment with GCN/SAGE and with our enhanced reweight strategy on Collab.
- **Analysis**: Analysis on Collab (we include Collab but will release analysis code for all datasets upon acceptance).

Please install corresponding packages via:
```linux
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

```
